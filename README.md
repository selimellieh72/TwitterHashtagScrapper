## About

TwitterHashtagScrapper is a handful Python script that scraps any number of tweets for a given hashtag name. The script is configurable and customizable as needed. I've made it originally for a client but since then I've decided to make it open source

## Configuration

- account.txt<br/>

  - Start by replacing [username] and [password] with your own username and password for your Twitter account. The script will use this account to login and scrap the posts.

- hashtags.txt<br/>

  In hashtags.txt, you can write down any number of hashtags you want to scrap posts for. (Seperated by new lines)

## How To Use

> **Warning**
> Before using the script, make sure you've configured it properly and made the necessary adjustments as per the Configuration section.
